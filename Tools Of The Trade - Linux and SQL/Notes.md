-> Operating Systems : It's the interface between the computer hardware and the user. The operating system, or the OS as it's commonly called, is responsible for making the computer run as efficiently as possible while also making it easy to use.

-> Hardware : Physical components of a computer.

-> Application : A program that performs a specific task.

-> Applications send request to Operating Systems, which is then forwaded to the hardware by the Operating System. Also, the hardware commuicates with the Operating system which is then forwaded to the application by the Operating System.

-> When you boot, or turn on, your computer, either a BIOS or UEFI microchip is activated. The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) is a microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is prevalent in older systems. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and replaces BIOS on more modern systems. Then they perform various loading instructions and at the last they activate the bootloader, which is a software program the boots the operating system.

-> Resource Allocation via OS : The OS handles resource and memory management to ensure the limited capacity of the computer system is used where it's needed most. A variety of programs, tasks, and processes are constantly competing for the resources of the central processing unit, or CPU.

-> Virtual Machine ; A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual version of a physical computer.

-> virtualization : Virtualization is the process of using software to create virtual representations of various physical machines.

-> Interface : A user interface is a program that allows a user to control the functions of the operating system.

-> Graphical User Interface (GUI) : A GUI is a user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer. Most operating systems can be used with a graphical user interface. Basic GUI components are - Start menu, Task bar, Desktop with icons and shortcuts.

-> Command Line Interface (CLI) : The command-line interface, or CLI, is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. These commands communicate with the operating system and execute tasks like opening programs.
